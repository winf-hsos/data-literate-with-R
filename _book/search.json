    "text": "“Data is the new oil. Like oil, data is valuable, but if unrefined, it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity. So, must data be broken down, analysed for it to have value.”\n\nIf we take this analogy seriously, the data, like oil, needs to be refined to turn it into something of value. Two important tools for refining data into a valuable output are data transformation and data visualization, both of which are the main focus of this book. In this part of the book, we first need to learn how to transform data so that we can apply visualization later on.\nTo learn how to transform data, we need to learn how to to the following operations:\n\nRemove any variables we don’t currently need (or specify those we do need)\nRemove any records we don’t currently need (or specify those we do need)\nAdd new variables that don’t exist yet\nSummarize many records into one or a few numbers\nChange the order of the records\n\nThe goal of the following chapters is to introduce means to perform theses five operations with R."

    "text": "2.2 By column names\nThe easiest and intuitive way to specify the columns we want is by listing their names. We can pass one or more column names to the select() function. In case of two or more, we use commas to separate the names:\n\n# Just one column name\norders %>% \n  select(order_id)\n\n#> # A tibble: 2,874 x 1\n#>        order_id\n#>           <dbl>\n#> 1 1130007101519\n#> 2 1130014965839\n#> 3 1130026958927\n#> ...\n\n# A list of column names\norders %>% \n  select(order_id, total_price)\n\n#> # A tibble: 2,874 x 2\n#>        order_id total_price\n#>           <dbl>       <dbl>\n#> 1 1130007101519        94.7\n#> 2 1130014965839        32.2\n#> 3 1130026958927        30.2\n#> ...\n\nWhen we only want a few columns, this approach works fine and is usually a good choice. I expect you apply this method in more than 90% of all cases. However, there are cases when you’d wish there was something more flexible. Luckily, there is."
